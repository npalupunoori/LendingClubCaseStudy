## General Information
- This project is to analys lending club as part of case study module.
- While analyzing the data, goal is to learn EDA.
- Steps to perform EDA
    * Clean up the data
        - Removing null coloums.
        - Covert time realted coloums time coloums.
        - Convert the numeric string colums to intigers.
        - Box plot univariant analysis for outliners.
    * Univariant analysis
        - Create visalization of each coloumns.
        - Create data analysis for each data.
    * Bivariant analysis
        - Analyze each coloumn with loan status.
        - Analyze each coloumn of corelation.
