## General Information
- This project is to analys lending club as part of case study module.
- While analyzing the data, goal is to learn EDA.
- Steps to perform EDA
    * Clean up the data
        - Removing null coloums.
        - Covert time realted coloums time coloums.
        - Convert the numeric string colums to intigers.
        - Box plot univariant analysis for outliners.
    * Univariant analysis
        - Create visalization of each coloumns.
        - Create data analysis for each data.
    * Bivariant analysis
        - Analyze each coloumn with loan status.
        - Analyze each coloumn of corelation.

## Conclusions
- 85% of the loans are fully paid. only 15% of them are charged off loans.
- Higher Loan Amount are more likely to result in Charged off loan. Almost 1 out of 3 loans higher than 45k are charged off loans.
- Longer duration long terms are more likelt to result in charged off loan. 44% of charged off loan are with 60 months terms compare to only 21% for fully paid loans. 1 out of 4 loans with 60 month term were charged off.
- Loas with higher interest rates (Interest rate higher than 12% are more likely to be charged off. These charged off loans are more likely to collect less interest from them despite the higher interest because they are more likely to charg oof early.
- Loan Grad classification shows that only 35% of the charged off loans are A and B loan grades compare to 60% for fully paid loans.
- Looks like there is a pattern of trying to grad loand in lower A grade (A4 and A5) rarther than grading them atv (B1 and B2) which shows a significant low number of loans with grades B1 and B2 compare to A4 and A5 and to B3 and B4.
- The percentage of charged off loans is high for small business loans (approximately 27%) compare to overall charged off percentage of 15%.
- Higher Income brorowers are more likely to pay thier loans.
- Income verification does not help in reducing the probability of loans being charged off. 2/3 of charged off loans have gone throuigh income verfiication while only 55% of the fully paid loans were income verified. Most iof the verification were conducted on higher income borrowers who more likely to pay the loans,a nd it was performed more likely on the higher loan amounts.
- Debit to Income ratio higher than 12% are more likely reult in chaarged off loan, the veification of borrowers income is more occured with DTI higher than 17%. Small Business loans has lower DTI compare to other purpose loans despit the high proportion of charged off loans for these laons.
- 60% of charged off loans received at least 1 inquiry within the last 6 months while this percentage is 50% for fully paid loans.
- Higher revolving line utlization (>55%) is more likely lead to charge doff loan.
